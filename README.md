# Fontquick Model Generation
This repo is designed to create a recommendation engine for fonts.

## Dataset
The dataset will be uploaded to Kaggle in the near future. Data was scraped off of [Fontspace](www.fontspace.com). Some fonts failed to be scraped.
Fonts with no tags were excluded from the model's training, along with other select fonts.
